📊 Grafana Dashboards

Prebuilt dashboards are in the dashboards/ folder:

Node Exporter (Linux/Windows)

MySQL, Oracle, Kubernetes

Uptime Probes (Blackbox)

Import them using Grafana UI → "+ Import" → Upload .json

🔔 Alerts & Rules

Use the files in alerting/ to:

Set up HA Alertmanager

Define SLA/SLO-based Prometheus rules

Send alerts via Slack, email, PagerDuty, etc.

📈 Learn PromQL Easily

Find ready-to-use queries in examples/promql-queries.md, like:

CPU usage per node

Memory trend per week

Failed pings / down targets

Pod restarts in Kubernetes
